# Nee Soon Stuff

Side project about the smoking points. At least now I realise that they
cost $10,000 based on this [Today article][tod17], rather than $50,000.

This article also hinted at the design team: 3 NUS engineering students
who had been on exchange in Germany, United Kingdom, and South Korea.

27 individuals and private companies were mentioned as well. Will it be
possible to track them all down? Or at least the ones who chose to have
their names revealed?

## smoking.csv

This file will contain the source data to generate map markers.

## makemap.py

This Python script will build a map from the CSV data. We'll start with
a Google Map but may move on to work wiith other map platforms.
